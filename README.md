# OpenXMLOffice

OpenXMLOffice is an advanced .NET library that leverages the power of OpenXML SDK 3.0 to streamline the creation and manipulation of Office documents, with a primary focus on Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files. My mission is to enhance the document creation experience for developers by providing intuitive namespaces, classes, and utilities. The library is designed to offer maximum efficiency and ease of use, ensuring a seamless workflow. 

It's important to note that OpenXMLOffice supports the creation of documents that can be opened from Office 2013 onwards. However, not every feature is available from the 2013 version. For instance if new features are added as part of the 2016 version, they are kept in a namespace that explicitly mentions '2016.' Developers should be aware that if they use 2016 components in their document creation, the generated file can only be opened in 2016 and above versions without any issues.

## Scope Details

- **Easy Creation of Office Documents**: Create and manipulate Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files with ease.
- **OpenXML SDK 3.0**: Built on the robust foundation of the OpenXML SDK.
- **Modular Architecture**: Dedicated modules for each Office application for better manageability.
